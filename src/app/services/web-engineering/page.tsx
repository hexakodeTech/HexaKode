const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Why does my business need professional web engineering?",
    answer:
      "A professional website acts as your primary digital storefront. It builds trust, communicates your brand value, and ensures that customers looking for your services on Google or social media find a secure, credible platform instead of a broken generic page.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does web engineering cost in Kerala?",
    answer:
      "The cost of developing a custom web engineering platform depends entirely on the features, integrations, page volume, and CMS requirements. Custom Next.js projects require dedicated engineering but offer extreme long-term value, high security, and near-zero hosting costs compared to heavy subscription templates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom web platform?",
    answer:
      "Timeline spans depend on complexity. A custom corporate or business landing page project typically takes 2 to 4 weeks. Larger web applications with backend portals, client dashboards, or advanced database integrations may take 6 to 12 weeks from discovery to final deploy.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between custom web engineering and a template site?",
    answer:
      "Template-based websites (like generic WordPress or Wix) contain bloated, pre-written code, resulting in slow load speeds, poor security, and restrictive layout changes. Custom Next.js sites are coded from scratch, resulting in flawless performance, custom designs, robust security, and top-tier SEO flexibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my website be mobile-friendly and responsive?",
    answer:
      "Yes, 100%. We employ mobile-first CSS grids and fluid layouts. Every screen is meticulously tested on multiple physical mobile screens, tablets, and wide-screen desktops to ensure readability and flawless interaction transitions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure my website is optimized for SEO?",
    answer:
      "We configure structural technical SEO. This includes writing clean semantic HTML code, setting custom titles and descriptions for every page, automating sitemap generation, indexing robots directives, and implementing JSON-LD breadcrumb and service schema codes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide headless CMS integration?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We integrate headless CMS platforms like Sanity CMS. This gives your business team a user-friendly dashboard to edit text, post blogs, and update media. The content is compiled statically at build-time, preserving high speed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you migrate my legacy site to Next.js or React?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We specialize in legacy migrations. We will extract your current database contents, redesign the visual assets, build a high-performance React/Next.js frontend, and configure 301 redirects to ensure your legacy search engine ranks are preserved.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer maintenance and support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our partnership continues post-launch. We provide regular code audits, next-gen library upgrades, performance optimizations, bug fixes, and feature expansions to ensure your platform scales alongside your company's growth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we get started with your web engineering services?",
