const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How long does SEO take to show measurable results?",
    answer:
      "Organic SEO is a long-term compound growth engine. Technical fixes and local Google Business Profile improvements often yield noticeable local visibility boosts within 4 to 8 weeks. Comprehensive organic ranking growth on competitive keywords typically takes 3 to 6 months. However, once established, organic rankings deliver sustainable, low-cost leads for years.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does digital marketing cost in Kerala?",
    answer:
      "Digital marketing costs vary depending on the scope of services required—such as whether you need full-service SEO, Google Ads management, social media content creation, or a combination. HexaKode offers flexible, transparent packages tailored to small local businesses as well as growing enterprises. Contact us for a custom quote aligned with your revenue goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Google Ads better than organic SEO?",
    answer:
      "Both channels complement each other. Google Ads provides immediate traffic and lead flow within hours of launch, making it ideal for immediate sales or seasonal offers. Organic SEO builds long-term domain authority and delivers sustained, free organic leads without ongoing cost-per-click charges. We often recommend a hybrid strategy for maximum ROI.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide monthly marketing analytics reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes, 100%. Transparency is one of our core pillars. Every month, you receive a detailed, easy-to-understand performance report highlighting organic traffic growth, keyword ranks, Google Ads performance, leads generated, and cost per acquisition.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help local Kerala businesses rank on Google Maps?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Local SEO is one of our key specialties. We optimize your Google Business Profile, manage local citations, implement geo-targeted schema markup, and assist in building authentic customer review strategies to rank your business in local Google Maps search packs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you manage social media accounts like Instagram and Facebook?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our social media marketing services include strategy formulation, content calendar creation, high-quality graphic posts, video reels, targeted social ad campaigns (Meta Ads), and community engagement management.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is technical SEO and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Technical SEO refers to backend website optimizations that help search engine bots crawl, index, and understand your website efficiently. This includes optimizing site loading speed (Core Web Vitals), mobile responsiveness, SSL security, XML sitemaps, canonical tags, and structured JSON-LD schema data.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure the ROI of a digital marketing campaign?",
    answer:
      "We measure ROI by tracking concrete conversion events—such as form submissions, phone call clicks, booking confirmations, and direct online sales—against total campaign spend (ad spend + management fees). We focus on business growth metrics like Cost Per Lead (CPL) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).",
  },
  {
    question: "Will digital marketing work for B2B companies?",
    answer:
      "Yes. B2B digital marketing relies heavily on targeted technical SEO, professional LinkedIn marketing, content authority assets (case studies, whitepapers), and high-intent Google Search ads. We help B2B companies connect directly with decision-makers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we get started with HexaKode digital marketing services?",
    answer:
      "Getting started is simple. Book a free consultation or contact our team. We will conduct a baseline digital audit of your business, analyze your market competitors, and present a custom growth strategy during a discovery call.",
