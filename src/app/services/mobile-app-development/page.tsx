const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Why choose Flutter for mobile app development?",
    answer: "Flutter is Google's UI software development kit. It compiles directly to native ARM machine code. This delivers 60fps animations, near-instant load times, and native-level execution while allowing our engineers to build both Android and iOS apps from a single source code folder, cutting dev costs by half.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to develop a mobile app in Kerala?",
    answer: "Costs depend on complexity, backend architecture, third-party integrations, and user authentication schemas. Cross-platform apps using Flutter are much more cost-effective than building native Android and iOS apps separately, since they require half the developer resource hours to build and maintain.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to develop a cross-platform mobile application?",
    answer: "A standard MVP app project takes around 6 to 8 weeks. Larger platforms involving real-time GPS tracking, complex payment configurations, chat engines, or custom business dashboards may require 10 to 16 weeks to ensure quality execution and thorough multi-device testing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the advantage of cross-platform apps over native apps?",
    answer: "Cross-platform development (using Flutter) is faster, cost-efficient, and easier to maintain. When you update a feature or fix a bug, you deploy it once for both iOS and Android. This guarantees feature parity across platforms, whereas native requires maintaining two separate engineering teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle app store submission (Google Play Store & Apple App Store)?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. We manage the entire packaging, code signing, and deployment process. We compile production bundles, generate app store assets, configure developer accounts, set privacy policies, and guide the app through Google's and Apple's review teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you secure data in mobile applications?",
    answer: "We employ multi-layer security. This includes secure local encryption for offline storage, secure HTTPS/TLS data transport layers, certificate pinning, JWT authentication headers, dynamic API keys protection, and strict Firestore security rules checks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate third-party APIs (like payment gateways, maps, push notifications)?",
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in complex integrations. We hook up Google Maps, Razorpay, Stripe, Firebase Cloud Messaging, biometric logins, external hardware APIs, and custom enterprise databases, ensuring reliable data synchronization.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you provide the source code of the mobile app?",
    answer: "Yes. Upon project completion, we hand over full ownership of the Git repository, including clean source codes, configuration scripts, asset files, and detailed documentation required for future updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer post-launch maintenance, updates, and support?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer monthly maintenance retainers. This covers resolving crashes, updating code to support new Android and iOS versions, security updates, library upgrades, and adding new features as your user base grows.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we get started with mobile app development at HexaKode?",
    answer: "Simply book a free consultation or contact us. We'll set up a discovery call to discuss your ideas, map user requirements, select the ideal technology stack, and provide an implementation roadmap and quotation.",
