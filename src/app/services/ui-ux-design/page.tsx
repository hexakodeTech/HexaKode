const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is your UI/UX design process?",
    answer: "Our UI/UX design workflow follows a structured methodology: User Research & Competitor Benchmarking -> Information Architecture Mapping -> Wireframing (UX Layouts) -> Visual UI Design (Typography, Colors, Branding) -> Clickable Interactive Prototyping -> Usability Testing -> Developer Handoff.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is UI/UX design important for my product's business success?",
    answer: "UI/UX design directly impacts user conversion and retention metrics. A confusing interface or slow navigation frustrates users, leading to high abandonment rates. A custom, intuitive design streamlines product usage, increases purchase rates, and builds brand loyalty.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you conduct user research and usability testing?",
    answer: "Yes, user research is core to our process. We interview stakeholders, gather feedback, audit competitor layouts, map user personas, and test high-fidelity clickable prototypes with actual users to locate usability friction before coding starts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What design tools do you use for wireframing and prototyping?",
    answer: "We primarily utilize Figma. It is the industry standard for collaborative user interface design. We build design systems, configure token variables, draw wireframes, build high-fidelity visual screens, and link interactive clickable prototypes in Figma.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the design is accessible (WCAG compliant)?",
    answer: "We incorporate WCAG standards into our design files. We test color contrast ratios using analyzer plug-ins, design large touch targets for mobile (minimum 44x44 pixels), verify screen reader structural grids, and define clear focus states for keyboard users.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design UI/UX for both mobile apps and web platforms?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. We design interfaces for web dashboards, responsive websites, SaaS platforms, native iOS (Apple Human Interface Guidelines), Android apps (Material Design), and custom desktop system tools, optimizing layouts for every platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide a design system or component library?",
    answer: "Yes, every custom project includes a tokenized design system library in Figma. This includes centralized styles for buttons, input fields, navigation blocks, global color tokens, typographies, icons, and layout parameters to ensure brand consistency.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you collaborate with developers during the handoff process?",
    answer: "We ensure developer handoffs are seamless. We configure layout grids, define CSS/Tailwind variables, export visual assets in multiple formats, organize Figma screens, and maintain communication during coding phases to resolve visual layout issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you improve or redesign my existing application's user interface?",
    answer: "Yes, we specialize in UI/UX redesigns. We audit your existing application to locate usability bottlenecks, run contrast checks, map user friction points, and deliver a modernized visual interface while preserving key brand parameters.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the UI/UX design phase typically take?",
    answer: "Timeline spans depend on complexity. A corporate website UI project takes 2 to 4 weeks. Designing complex SaaS dashboards, mobile apps, or multi-role software portals with 20+ screens typically requires 6 to 10 weeks from discovery to developer handoff.",
